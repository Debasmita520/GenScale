Description: This package calculates the bias and mean squared error of various proposed estimators for two generalized exponential populations with a common scale model.
	     The estimators used include the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, Lindley’s method, Tierney & Kadane’s approach, and MCMC approximations. 
	     Using these estimators, we can construct several classification rules, such as the Bayes classification rule and the likelihood accordance rule, 
	     and can compute the probability of misclassification for each rule. Moreover this methodology has also been proved on real life dataset in this package.
